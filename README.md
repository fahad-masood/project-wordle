# Word Game - Part of the Joy of React Project 1

In this project, I developed a popular online word game, Wordle:

[Experience the Game](https://word-game-fahad.netlify.app/)

## How to Participate:

Players are given 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. Clues are provided to eliminate incorrect letters and indicate whether the correct letters are in the right positions. A visible keyboard is provided for reference.

## Key Features:

The game offers three potential outcomes:

- **Correct:** When the guessed letter is in the right position, the box turns green.
- **Misplaced:** If the letter exists in the word but is in the wrong slot, the box turns yellow.
- **Incorrect:** For letters not present in the word, the box appears dark gray.

Winning and losing conditions:

- A joyful banner displays upon victory.
- Conversely, a somber banner is shown upon defeat.
- Winning requires guessing the word accurately, while six incorrect attempts lead to a loss.

User-Friendly Keyboard:

- Letter colors correspond to those on the game board:
  - Correct letters have a green background with white text.
  - Misplaced letters are displayed with a yellow background and white text.
  - Incorrect letters have a dark gray background with white text.
  - Unused letters are represented with a light gray background and black text.

Players can restart the game once the outcome is revealed, a distinction from the original Wordle game, which allows only one daily play.
